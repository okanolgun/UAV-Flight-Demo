# UAV-Flight-Demo
Drone flying simulator that you can create with the coordinates you enter and your own API key.

I developed a simple drone flying simulator using Python and Google Maps API. 
After running the code according to the coordinates you entered, you can direct your situation with the arrow keys and make it go in the direction you want.

You can also try drone flying simulator using the sample locations in the text file. Or you can use your own home coordinates to try. 
But you'll have to get some Google Maps API before you try it.

Google Maps API allows website designers to add maps to their sites using the Javascript language on the Google Maps infrastructure.

After running the application, you can direct your drone with the arrow keys.
You can find sample map images in the file.

Unfortunately, during the development process, I could not access a map view that was updated as the drone moved.
I hope that one day I will update this repository and have access to the application I want.
